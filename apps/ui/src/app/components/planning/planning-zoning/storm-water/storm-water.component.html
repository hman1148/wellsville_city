			Storm Water Prevention Tips
		</h2>
		<p class="intro-text">
			Controlling erosion and preventing the spread of pollutants are important reasons to understand
			how your property impacts storm water runoff. Storm water runoff occurs when rain or snow melt
			cannot percolate into the soil or sediments. Modern buildings, roads and parking lots cause
			dramatic increases in storm water runoff because they are made of impervious materials. To make
			matters worse, water flowing across these surfaces pick up trash and pollutants such as oil,
			pesticides, and other toxins on their way to local streams, rivers and lakes.
		</p>
		<p class="intro-text">
			Creative landscaping that takes storm water into consideration is the best solution to runoff
			problems. Walk the perimeter of your property during, or shortly after, a heavy run and look for
			areas that have water running into a street or onto sidewalks. Using plants, gravel or a
			combination of both in these areas will slow the flow of water and allow it to seep into the
			ground. Incorporate wood decks, gravel or interlocking bricks and stones rather than cement
			whenever possible to increase percolation. It's best to limit the use of high maintenance areas,
			such as green lawns. If you choose to keep a lawn area, incorporate landscaping swales. These are
			low dips in the lawn that allow water to collect and percolate rather than flowing off the grass.

				Take care of your trash, trash bins, and dumpsters. Post "No littering" signs and enforce
				anti-litter laws. Provide a sufficient number of litter receptacles for your home or business.
				Clean out and cover litter receptacles frequently to prevent spillage. Keep dumpster areas
				clean. Recycle materials whenever possible. Use all of a product before disposing of the
				container. Ensure that only appropriate solid wastes are added to the solid waste container.
				Certain wastes such as hazardous wastes, appliances, fluorescent lamps, pesticides, etc., may
				not be disposed of in solid waster containers. Take special care when loading or unloading
				wastes to minimize losses. Inspect dumpsters and trash bins weekly for leaks and to ensure lids
				are on tightly. Replace any that are leaking, corroded, or otherwise deteriorating. Sweep and
				clean the storage area regularly and clean up spills immediately.

		<!-- What is a Storm Drain -->
		<div class="news-section">
			<h3>What is a Storm Drain?</h3>
			<p>
				A storm drain is the grate openings in the street that collects water from rain and melting snow
				to minimize street flooding. Rainwater often carries street debris, trash, leaves, fertilizer,
				pesticides, grass clippings, pet waste, paints, anti-freeze, used motor oil and bare soils that
				end up in the storm drains when people dispose of them improperly.
			</p>
		</div>

		<!-- Where Does It Go -->
		<div class="news-section">
			<h3>Where Does It Go?</h3>
			<p>
				Everything that we do outdoors has an effect on the water bodies around us. As water flows it
				collects difference pollutants that are left in its path. It then travels to the nearest storm
				drain where it is carried to the nearest lake, pond, river or stream. Let's make sure "Only rain
				goes down the drain!"
			</p>
		</div>

		<!-- Snow and Storm Water -->
		<div class="news-section">
			<h3>Snow and Storm Water</h3>
			<p>
				As snow piles up in the winter, we often turn to salt to melt snow and ice. Excess salt can seep
				into groundwater and stormwater runoff. Effective ice control can help prevent excess salt runoff
				to our waterways.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many alternatives to salt, including potassium chloride, calcium chloride and magnesium
				acetate. Most can be found in hardware stores under various trade names, so check the labels for
				chemical content. While these alternatives can be spread in a dry form or sprayed as a liquid,
				their best use occurs when they are used with salt. They tend to increase the efficiency of salt
				thereby reducing the amount that needs to be applied.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keep in mind that your first line of defense should simply be to shovel sidewalks and pathways to
				keep them clean and to prevent ice from forming. Also consider that salt and de-icers are not
				effective when more than 3 inches of snow have accumulated.

			What is Storm Water Runoff?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Storm water runoff is the rain or snow melt that runs off streets, rooftops, parking lots, lawns and
			other land surfaces. As communities develop, more impervious surfaces are created and less rainfall
			can soak into the ground. This increases flooding and stream bank erosion. Storm water also picks up
			pollutants as it flows across land surfaces. Pollutants include:
		</p>
		<ul class="pollutants-list">
			<li>Sediment from bare areas like construction sites</li>
			<li>Pesticides and fertilizers from lawns, parks, and roadsides</li>
			<li>Bacteria and disease causing organisms from pet waste and failing septic systems</li>
			<li>Oil and grease from car leaks, gas stations and industrial areas</li>
			<li>Salt used on roads and driveways</li>
			<li>
				Toxic chemicals from leaks, spills, and auto wear and exhaust. Sometimes pollutants (e.g., used
				oil, paint, thinners, etc) are illegally dumped directly into storm drains and waterways.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<!-- Where Does Storm Water Go -->
	<p-card styleClass="content-card">
		<h2 class="section-title">
			<i class="pi pi-map-marker" aria-hidden="true"></i>
			Where Does the Storm Water Go?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Storm water typically flows into storm drains on parking lots and street curbs where it enters
			underground pipes called storm sewers. Unlike sanitary sewers, storm sewers do not lead to a
			treatment plant. So storm water runoff directed to storm sewers usually receives no treatment before
			entering our streams, rivers, and lakes. The result can be the contamination of our drinking water
			supplies.
		</p>
		<p>
			As storm water runs off from a building or driveway it carries with it fertilizers, salts,
			insecticides that were applied too heavily, too carelessly, or too near the time of a storm. Storm
			water also carries oils, paint, chrome, and other products that may chip or seep from automobiles.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another contaminant carried in storm water is the fecal material from dogs, horses, and other
			animals. These harmful contaminants stay suspended and are taken downstream to food producing
			agricultural fields, livestock watering systems, and fish inhabited waterways.

		</h2>

		<div class="best-practice">
			<h3>
				<i class="pi pi-trash" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				Dispose of Household Hazardous Waste Properly
			</h3>
			<p>
				Never dump household hazardous waste such as pesticides, fertilizers, paint or solvents into a
				storm drain, open waterway or ditch. Storm drains discharge directly into canals and then streams
				without the benefit of treatment, unlike the drains inside homes and businesses that connect to
				the sanitary sewer system. Beyond posing a threat to our health and environment, such dumping is
				illegal.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="best-practice">
			<h3>
				<i class="pi pi-ban" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				Don't Fill Drainage Ditches
			</h3>
			<p>
				If your home has a drainage ditch or swale, do not fill it in. Leaves swept to the curb will not
				be collected and can clog storm drains. Dumping yard waste into storm drains or waterways is
				harmful to the rivers and is illegal.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="best-practice">
			<h3>
				<i class="pi pi-times-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				Please Don't Litter
			</h3>
			<p>
				Trash left along our roadways, ditches, and stream banks washes into our waterways through rain
				and melting snow. Not only is littering illegal, it is an eyesore which can endanger wildlife and
				can allow stagnant water to breed mosquitoes. Debris can also block drain inlets, preventing
				efficient drainage.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="best-practice">
			<h3>
				<i class="pi pi-car" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				Maintain Cars and Driveways
			</h3>
			<ul class="habits-list">
				<li>Maintain vehicles to prevent leaking fluids from washing into stormwater.</li>
				<li>Absorb leaks on the driveway with sand or cat litter, then sweep and place in the trash.</li>
				<li>
					Wash cars at a commercial car wash, or over gravel, if possible, to avoid the soapy runoff from
					entering the storm drains. Car wash businesses are required to dispose of the water through the
					sanitary sewer system, where it can be treated.
				</li>
				<li>Sweep debris from sidewalks and driveways instead of washing it away with water.</li>
